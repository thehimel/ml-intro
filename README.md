An introduction to machine learning.

## Motivation

I learn something better when I feel excited about it. And the save have happened for Machine Learning.
I'm pretty excited to learn Machine Learning.

To get introduced with ML, I have a known instructor who teaches things in a very easy manner. His name is Mosh Hamedani.
So, I found a tutorial on his YouTube channel and creating this repository as an exercise to this tutorial.
